# 🤖 Autonomous Robot Path Finder using Artificial Intelligence

An AI-based simulation project that demonstrates how an autonomous robot can intelligently find the optimal path from a start point to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The project uses the **A*** (A-Star) algorithm for efficient and heuristic-driven pathfinding in a 2D grid environment.

---

## 🧭 **Project Overview**

This mini-project aims to simulate a robot’s autonomous navigation behavior using Artificial Intelligence concepts.
The robot navigates through a grid-based environment, identifying the shortest collision-free route between a start and goal position.

**Key Features:**

* Implements **A*** Pathfinding Algorithm
* Visualizes grid, obstacles, and computed optimal path
* Demonstrates AI-based decision-making for navigation
* Easy to extend for real-world robotic systems

---

## 🧠 **Concepts Used**

* **Artificial Intelligence** for decision-making and optimization
* **Search Algorithms (A*)** for path planning
* **Heuristics (Manhattan Distance)** for goal estimation
* **Python & Matplotlib** for simulation and visualization

---

## ⚙️ **Algorithm Used – A* (A-Star) Algorithm**

The A* algorithm finds the shortest path using both the actual cost (`g(n)`) and estimated heuristic cost (`h(n)`):

[
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
]

Where:

* `g(n)` = cost from start to current node
* `h(n)` = heuristic distance to goal (Manhattan distance)

A* ensures both **optimality** and **efficiency**, making it ideal for robot pathfinding.

* Black cells → Obstacles
* Grey path → Optimal path generated by A*

Example:

| Grid Representation | Description               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 🟩 Start Node       | Robot's starting point    |
| 🟥 Goal Node        | Target destination        |
| ⬛ Obstacles         | Blocked cells             |
| ⚪ Path              | Optimal path traced by A* |
